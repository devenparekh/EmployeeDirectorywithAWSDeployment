Steps to connect Ec2 instance to RDS and configuring the security group:

1) Create VPC in a region and select 2 AZs.
2) Create 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets in both AZs.
3) Create Ec2 instance in the above created vpc and select the public subnet 1 for the instance and upload jar file to ec2.
4) Create Security groups for Ec2 instance and for DB security groups seperately. Follow the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty6UIS5xvGc
5) Go to RDS and create a subnet group in the created vpc and select 2 private subnets created before for storing the rds instance.
6) Create the RDS instance, apply the security group created before for the 3306 port to the rds instance.
7) follow the command above from ec2 instance and create a db in rds instance.
8) get the endpoint and port number from rds instance and replace it with localhost:8080 in spring.datasource.url in your application properties file, change the username and password according to rds instance.
9) that's it! happy websiting!
